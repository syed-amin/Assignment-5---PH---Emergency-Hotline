<!-- Answer the questions: -->
1.What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
----> 
getElementById : Finds one element by its id.
getElementsByClassName : Finds all elements with that class (gives a list).
querySelector : Finds the first element that matches a CSS selector (like #id, .class, div p).
querySelectorAll : Finds all elements matching the CSS selector (gives a list).

2.How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?
---->
const newDiv = document.createElement("div");
newDiv.textContent = "Hello!";
document.body.appendChild(newDiv);

3.What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?
---->
When click a child element, the event goes up step by step to its parent, then parentâ€™s parent until document. 
Like bubbles rising in water.

4.What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
---->
Event Delegation : Put one event listener on a parent instead of many on each child.
Useful because: less code, faster, works for new elements too.

5.What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?
---->
preventDefault() : Stops the default action (like stopping a link from opening).
stopPropagation() : Stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
